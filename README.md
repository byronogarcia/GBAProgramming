# GBAProgramming

This repository will be utilized for my small programs that are helping me learn to program for the GBA (GameBoy Advance)
To run these programs you will need a GBA emulator which runs .gba files. I am using the visualboyadvance-m for MacOS. This emulator can be found here (http://vba-m.com/)

Contains:

RectMovement - A program that has a rectangle move left to right, and reappers below its initial point to repeat the animation
